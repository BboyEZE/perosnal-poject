                <p>Climbing gyms can make or break the climbing experience. I have been to a few gyms myself so I will give a rundown on all the goods and bad's I have experienced.</p>

                    <h4><a href="https://www.verticalendeavors.com/visit-us/hours-locations/glendale-heights-il/">Vertical Endeavors</a></h4>
                    <p>Vertical Endeavors in Glendale Heights is my personal main rock climbing gym. It is a great gym, with some fantastic setters and wonderful community. There is a fantastic spread of top rope/lead routes along with boulders. It is a great place to get practice.</p>

                    <h4><a href="https://faclimbing.com/chicago/block-37/">First Ascent (Block 37)</a></h4>
                    <p>The First Ascent of Block 37 is a wonderful bouldering only gym. There is around 150 different routes for someone to enjoy there of various difficulty. The sets are a little lacking when it comes to very technical work but all around a fantastic bouldering gym.</p>

                    <h4><a href="https://faclimbing.com/arlington-heights/info/">First Ascent (Arlington Heights)</a></h4>
                    <p>The newest climbing gym, having opened in August, the First Ascent in Arlington heights is an extremely nice gym for its small size. It offers a decent amount in the forms of top rope, boulders and lead climbing. It does come with a fantastic gym that may take up too much space but has everything someone needs to stay in shape.</p>

                    <h4><a href="https://momentumclimbing.com/lehi/">Momentum (Lehi)</a></h4>
                    <p>The Momentum in Lehi is probably the best gym for bouldering I have been to. There are over 200 routes for one to do. The community in the gym was fantastic, whether being the workers or other climbers being extremely friendly.</p>

                    <h4><a href="https://momentumclimbing.com/sandy/">Momentum (Sandy)</a></h4>
                    <p>The Momentum in sandy was an average climbing gym. It had many top rope routes however no auto belays(system that allows you to do a climb without someone belaying you). The boulder section was a little too cramped however the routes were </p>

                </div>
                <p>All of these gyms are recommended and are only an example of good ones in the Chicago land and Salt Lake City area. The Momentum in Lehi and the First Ascent of Block 37 are the favorite because my bias is towards bouldering.</p>
