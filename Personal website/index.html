                <h2>The Art of Climbing</h2>
                    <p>Rock Climbing is a sport unlike any other. I have been climbing for a little over a year and no other sport has made me feel the way climbing has. The ridiculous amount of body control required will make one feel weak to such an extent never felt before that rock climbing.</p>
                <section>
                    <h3 class="lefttext">What is rock climbing?</h3>
                    <p>Climbing is the sport in which a person does exactly what it says, they climb. Climbers have 2 main types of ways that they climb being.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Top Rope:</b> The standard form of climbing is which a rope or auto belay system is hooked up to the top of a wall. The person then climbs that wall and when they reach the top they are finished</li>
                        <li><b>Lead:</b> Lead climbing is a more advanced form of top roping. The person in lead climbing must climb up the terrain and then hook themselves into the wall as they go. Instead of the fall being standard straight from the top and they can be caught, a lead climber will fall at the very least all the way back to their most recent anchor holding them in.</li>
                        <li><b>Boulder:</b> By far my favorite form of climbing is bouldering. In bouldering a person climbs a wall and try to get to the very top and either top out (going all the way up the route and then coming back down via walking) or through climbing/jumping down. In bouldering there are no ropes, just the pads below you. It is very easy to hurt yourself bouldering if you do not know how to fall correctly.</li>
                    </ul>
