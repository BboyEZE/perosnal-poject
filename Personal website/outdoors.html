                <h2>Outdoor Climbing</h2>
                <p>Outdoor Climbing is fun, intense, scary, exhilarating and how climbing was made for. In the great outdoors one can climb all that mother nature has to offer. Routes inside pale in comparison to actual rock. Outdoor climbs are not brightly colored and specific to how they are meant to be done so any number of people can do the same route a vastly different way. From a someone who has barely any experience outside I can safely say that the experience is surreal. Anyone no matter what their current skill level with climbing is should get out and try it at least one time in their lives. </p>
                <h3>The Dangers of the Outdoors</h3>
                <p>When Climbing outside, there is a higher chance for someone to get hurt due to the pure amount of obstacles that can be present and the higher likelihood to mess up. For example, when bouldering outdoors there is no promise the ground will be nice and flat for crash pads to catch you. Terrain can be bumpy and unleveled along with trees being directly on your back at all times. The same can be said for Rope climbing. The responsibility to make sure all the ropes and anchors are all secured now lie on the climber compared to the employees of a gym.</p>
                <h3>The Greatness of the Outdoors</h3>
                <p>While outdoor climbing may seem intimidating, it really is also a great experience. Being outdoors and climbing up rocks is how rock climbing was meant to be done. There is nothing more satisfying than finishing an outdoor route and being able to look towards the horizon and see a beautiful view. There is nothing in life that really comes close to emulating the feeling of doing something that is meant to be enjoyed in the great outdoors.</p>
